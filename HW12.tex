% Question 1
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item A group of researchers is running an experiment over the course of 30 months, 
with a single observation collected at the end of each month. Let $X_1, ..., X_{30}$
denote the observations for each month. From prior studies, the researchers know that
\[X_i \sim f_X(x),\]
but the mean $\mu_X$ is unknown, and they wish to conduct the following test
\begin{align*}
H_0&: \mu_X = 0\\
H_a&: \mu_X > 0.
\end{align*}
At month $k$, they have accumulated data $X_1, ..., X_k$ and they have the 
$t$-statistic
\[T_k = \frac{\bar{X} - 0}{S_k/\sqrt{n}}.\]
The initial plan was to test the hypotheses after all data was collected (at the 
end of month 30), at level $\alpha=0.05$. However, conducting the experiment is 
expensive, so the researchers want to ``peek" at the data at the end of month 20 
to see if they can stop it early. That is, the researchers propose to check 
whether $t_{20}$ provides statistically discernible support for the alternative. 
If it does, they will stop the experiment early and report support for the 
researcher's alternative hypothesis. If it does not, they will continue to month 
30 and test whether $t_{30}$ provides statistically discernible support for the
alternative.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What values of $t_{20}$ provide statistically discernible support for the
  alternative hypothesis?
  \textbf{Solution:} We can calculate the value of $t_{20}$ that provide discernible support for the alternative by finding the t-value that is where the $\alpha = 0.05$ cutoff is. For $t_{20}$, that value is 1.7291, so any values greater than or equal to that provide support for the alternative.

  \item What values of $t_{30}$ provide statistically discernible support for the
  alternative hypothesis?
  \textbf{Solution:} Using the same approach as for $t_{20}$, but replacing n=20 with n=30, we find that the $\alpha = 0.05$ t-value is 1.6991, and consequently any values greater than this provide statistically discernible support for the alternative.
  \item Suppose $f_X(x)$ is a Laplace distribution with $a=0$ and $b=4.0$.
  Conduct a simulation study to assess the Type I error rate of this approach.\\
  \textbf{Note:} You can use the \texttt{rlaplace()} function from the \texttt{VGAM}
  package for \texttt{R} \citep{VGAM}.
  
  
  \textbf{Solution:} To conduct the simulation study, we take $n$ number of observations ($X$) from the Laplace distribution $a = 0$ and $b = 4.0$. For this set of $X$, we then calculate the t-statistic using the formula provided above, as we can calculate the mean and standard deviation for the simulated observations and we also know $n$ (either 20 or 30). Then, we compare this t-statistic to the critical points we calculated in a) and b), where if the simulated t-statistic is greater than the critical point, we reject the null hypothesis. By counting the number of rejections in the 10000 samples, and then dividing it by the total number of samples (10000), we can calculate the Type I error. We find that for $t_{20}$, the $Type I error = 0.0510$ and for $t_{20}$ $Type I error = 0.0494$. These values are close to the expected $\alpha = 0.05$.

  \item Perform a simulation study to assess the robustness of the $T$ test. 
  Specifically, generate samples of size $n=15$ from the Beta(10,2), Beta(2,10), 
  and Beta(10,10) distributions and conduct the following hypothesis tests against 
  the actual mean for each case (e.g., $\frac{10}{10+2}$, $\frac{2}{10+2}$, and 
  $\frac{10}{10+10}$). 
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item What proportion of the time do we make an error of Type I for a
    left-tailed test?
    \item What proportion of the time do we make an error of Type I for a
    right-tailed test?
    \item What proportion of the time do we make an error of Type I for a
    two-tailed test?
    \item How does skewness of the underlying population distribution effect
    Type I error across the test types?
